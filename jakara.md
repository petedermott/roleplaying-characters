# Jakara
Jakara was born into a painful life. Her "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life and gave her up to a cultist faction at the age of 10 in exchange for every lasting youth. 

A novice from the cultist faction tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a demi plane where she survived and subsisted for 30 years, holding her in the plane did caused her to not age physically but she aged mentally and intellectually.

Eventually a group of wayfarer adventures found their way into the plane and were able to rescue her, returning her to real world and bringer her into the guild.

Despite the horrors and struggles the coke with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament and a wide eyed positive attitude.

Additional points:

- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long)
- Occasionally prone to temper tantrums 
- Uneasy in large group settings, has a few friends she would die for.
