# Jakara
Jakara was born into a painful life. Her "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life and gave her up to a cultist faction at the age of 10 in exchange for every lasting youth.

A novice from the cultist faction tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a demi plane where she survived and subsisted for 30 years, holding her in the plane did caused her to not age physically but continued to so mentally and intellectually.

The plane she found herself in was dark and unforgiving. Days lasted 30 hours but only gave 10 of usable daylight, temperatures were a consistent 5 to 7 degrees and the ground was mostly rough heath land and tundra. She survived mostly by foradging for wild berries, and catching "godj", small fish-like creatures that look similar to crawfish but taste vaguely like tomatoes.

Jakara's time in the plane was not wholely alone, Fetchlings would often stalk her and she learnt early to move between camps in order to keep them at bay or fend them off with the rudiemntary magic she was only just beginning to learn.

5 years ago a group of wayfarer adventures found their way into the plane and were able to rescue her, returning her to real world and bringer her into the guild.

Despite the horrors and struggles the coke with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament, a wide eyed positive attitude and is almost incapable of lieing

Additional points:

- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long)
- Occasionally prone to temper tantrums 
- Uneasy in large group settings, has a few friends she would die for.
