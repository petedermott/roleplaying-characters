# Jakara
## Early life

Jakara was born into a painful life. Her alcoholic "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life. 

Given that she was the result of one of her mothers numerous short term relationships she does not know who her Father is, nor does she care to having only been told how he "dropped us like a sack of shit" when her mother was pregnant (if this is true or just manipulation by her mother is unknown)

At the age of 10 her mother gave her up to a cultist faction in exchange for ever lasting youth. A novice acolyte tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a shadow plane where she survived and subsisted for 20 years, life in the plane caused her to not age physically but she continued to grow mentally and intellectually.

## Early life in the Shadow Plane
The plane she found herself in was cold, dark and unforgiving. Days lasted 30 hours but only gave 7 hours of usable daylight, temperatures were a consistent 0 to 2 degrees and the ground was rough heath land and tundra. To the west lay a desolate, windswept desert, with little cover from the storm force winds and no possibility of food Jakara took a single month long expedition into the waste, she very nearly didn't make it back. To the south and east lay a wild ocean and perilous cliffs and a vast mountain range to the north. 

Jakara's time in the plane was not wholly alone. Part of the devil binding process paired her with Razack, a devil who was supposed to take over her soul in the binding process. Razack demented thoughts crept into her head and he would frequently boast about his power and the destruction he would reck upon the world. However, he was stuck in the Shadow Plane as much as Jakara was and the two formed an uneasy truce during their time together.

Additionally, Fetchlings would often stalk her, and she learnt early to move between camps in order to avoid them, if it came down to it she would fend them off with the rudimentary magic she was only just beginning to learn.

She made occasional efforts to climb the northern mountains, once discovering a cave containing the corpse of a long deceased frost pixie. Jakara thought it would be disrespectful to leave this creature to the elements and decided to take it down the mountain to give it a humane burial, however as soon as she attempted to move it the body shattered instantly leaving only its delicate (but surprisingly sturdy) irridesant wings. These were most beautiful things that Jakara had ever seen and when she returned home she bound them with leather and fashioned them into a necklace in memory of the  forgotten creature.


## Later planes life
As the years past she grew more accustomed to the fetchlings, even eventually managing to be-friend one of the smaller runts creatures which she named Yoko. A cruel and vicious creature, Yoko was initially only tolerated because of his desire not to rip Jakara apart, and she would often use him as a target for her spell practice. During one of these practice sessions she managed to polymorph him into a small lizard which he seemed to take to, even becoming enraged if she ever tried to turn him back and fighting with any creature that tried to harm her.

2 years ago (1189) there was an incident. She didn't know what happened but Jakara felt a moment of immense, horrific pain as Razack was ripped from her. A quirk of the shadow plane meant that he didn't immediately disappear but was realised in his true corpreal form. Weak and helpless Razack begged for death in order to return to his home, Jakara agreed but only on the condition that he aid her return to the real world, Razack begrudingly accepted.

## The escape
A year ago a group of wayfarer adventures lead by Reinar found their way into the plane on the hunt for Reinar's brother, they didn't find him but they were able to recover Jakara. Given that she had no desire to seek out her mother they allowed her entry into the guild.

Of all the Wayfarers, Jakara became closest to Nylanda Spayle, her isolation meant that she has missed out on a whole lot of growing up and she still struggles to follow social cues and niceties. The two get along well although Nylanda thinks of her a little sister even though she is actually

Despite the horrors and struggles that come with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament, a wide eyed positive attitude and is almost incapable of deception.

## Life goals

1. In high societal social situations
2. In a church or with a member of the clergy
3. In the dark


## How Jakara feels about...

### Heyton Aldalayne
Nervous, big boss man is scary. Feels like she is a little bit of an imposter in the guild, even though he has always been polite she is never at ease when in his presence.

### Skallaban Trazandi
Pretty happy and a touch melancholy. He is the wise old grandpa she never had

### Inisha Arklow
A combination of awe and distaste. She reminds Jakara of her mother but she cannot deny the mage's skill.

### Marridon Geltair
Fear and distrust. She hates the clergy and anything remotely religous, she fears he may snatch her away again, will not like to be in the same room as him.

### Erris Banstrom
Neutral. She seems nice enough but they don't often run in the same circles, Erris seems a little stuck up?

### Fabin Meer
Jovial. He's fun to be around but no leader, best taken in small doses

### Nylanda Spayle
OMG BFF LOL, she's so smart and nice and clever and Jakara will.not.leave.her.alone.

### Delly Astaquin-Serron
Annoying but heart in the right place, she needs to learn to let things go sometimes.

### Old Koll
He seems pretty smart but a bit of a bull-shitter, doesn't really believe anything he says.

### Albin Hett
Shy and nervous - she has a bit of a crush on him.

### Jixett
Sad about his story and he's a bit creepy and weird but he makes some damn fine clothes, maybe he could make me something?

## Other NPCs
### Darla
Fuck this stuck up bitch, thinks way to highly of herself. GTFO

### Solan
So full of shit

### Gramson
He seems a little crazy? Geniune guy though..


## Additional points
- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long) dislikes alcohol for what it did to her mother
- Prone to temper tantrums when not getting her own way
- Uneasy when left alone, dislikes the dark, liable for a panic attack when alone in the dark. Has to sleep in the same room as others
- She has a serious distrust of the clergy and related religious institutions, cannot differentiate between cultists and regular priests
- None materialistic, only owns things that the Wayfarers have given her, has no desire for riches and social status.
- Randomly believes that all innkeepers know each other and will constantly ask for "the usual" no matter where she is
- Will "forget" about Dark Sky if it happens

## Shadow Plane notes
Like the upside down, permanently dark, difficult to survive, dangerous creatures, strange fungous, like silent hill town, there are odd shadowy versions of places that exist in the material plane
