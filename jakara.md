# Jakara
## Early life

Jakara was born into a painful life. Her alcoholic "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life. 

Given that she was the result of one of her mothers numerous short term relationships she does not know who her Father is, nor does she care to having only been told how he "dropped us like a sack of shit" when her mother was pregnant (if this is true or just manipulation by her mother is unknown)

At the age of 10 her mother gave her up to a cultist faction in exchange for every lasting youth. A novice acolyte tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a shadow plane where she survived and subsisted for 20 years, life in the plane caused her to not age physically but she continued to grow mentally and intellectually.

## Early life in the Shadow Plane
The plane she found herself in was dark and unforgiving. Days lasted 30 hours but only gave 10 hours of usable daylight, temperatures were a consistent 5 to 7 degrees and the ground was mostly rough heath land and tundra in the south with vast a vast mountain range to the north. 

Jakara's time in the plane was not wholly alone. Part of the devil binding process paired her with Razack, an evil devil who was supposed to take over her soul in the binding process. Razack was cruel and demented and crept into her inner-most thoughts, he would frequently boast about his power and the destruction he would reck upon the world. However, he was stuck in the Shadow Plane as much as Jakara was and the two formed an uneasy truce during their time together.

Additionally, Fetchlings(?) would often stalk her, and she learnt early to move between camps in order to avoid them, if it came down to it she would fend them off with the rudimentary magic she was only just beginning to learn.

She made occasional efforts to climb the northern mountains and made decent progress, once discovering a cave containing a long deceased spell caster and their book of spells. However, eventually travel would be made impossible by the dark and cold and treacherous terrain, so she always turned back.

She survived mostly by foraging for wild berries, and catching "Godji" (a small fish-like creature that look similar to crawfish but taste vaguely like tomatoes). To pass the time she would also read the spell book, as far as she could tell it contained instructions on various occult spells and cantrips which she practiced routinely, she was pleased that she only once summoned demons that wanted to eat her eyeballs.

## Later planes life

As the years past she grew more accustomed to the fetchlings, even eventually managing to be-friend one of the smaller runts creatures which she named Yoko. A cruel and vicious creature Yoko was initially only tolerated because of his desire not to rip Jakara apart, and she would often use him as a target for her spell practice. During one of these practice sessions she managed to polymorph him into a small lizard which he seemed to take to, even becoming enraged if she ever tried to turn him back and fighting with any creature that tried to harm her.

2 years ago (1189) there was an incident. She didn't know what happened but Jakara felt a moment of immense, horrific pain as Razack was ripped from her. A quirk of the shadow plane meant that he didn't immediately disappear but was realised in his true corpreal form. Weak and helpless Razack begged for death in order to return to his home, Jakara agreed but only on the condition that he aid her return to the real world, Razack begrudingly accepted.

Met up with Reinar in the plane after his stuff.

## The escape
3 years ago Jakara's mother suffered a minor heart attack, mostly caused by her many years of alcohol and substance abuse, she survived but came to the realisation that she had abandoned only child and felt remorseful and regretful. She contacted the Wayfarers and contracted them to seek out her daughter and return her in order to make amends. 

A year ago a group of wayfarer adventures found their way into the plane and were able to rescue her and returned her to real world. Given that she had no desire to seek out her mother they allowed her entry into the guild.

Of all the Wayfarers, Jakara became closest to Nylanda Spayle, her isolation meant that she has missed out on a whole lot of growing up and she still struggles to follow social cues and niceties. The two get along well although Nylanda thinks of her a little sister even though she is actually

Despite the horrors and struggles that come with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament, a wide eyed positive attitude and is almost incapable of deception.

## Additional points

- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long) dislikes alcohol for what it did to her mother
- Prone to temper tantrums when not getting her own way
- Uneasy when left alone, dislikes the dark, liable for a panic attack when alone in the dark. Has to sleep in the same room as others
- She has a serious distrust of the clergy and related religious institutions, cannot differentiate between cultists and regular priests
- None materialistic, only owns things that the Wayfarers have given her, has no desire for riches and social status.
- Randomly believes that all innkeepers know each other and will constantly ask for "the usual" no matter where she is
