# Jakara
## Early life

Jakara was born into a painful life. Her alcoholic "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life. 

Given that she was the result of one of her mothers numerous short term relationships she does not know who her Father is, nor does she care to having only been told how he "dropped us like a sack of shit" when her mother was pregnant (if this is true or just manipulation by her mother is unknown)

At the age of 10 her mother gave her up to a cultist faction in exchange for every lasting youth. A novice acolyte tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a demi plane where she survived and subsisted for 20 years, life in the plane caused her to not age physically but she continued to grow mentally and intellectually.

## Life in the demiplane
The plane she found herself in was dark and unforgiving. Days lasted 30 hours but only gave 10 hours of usable daylight, temperatures were a consistent 5 to 7 degrees and the ground was mostly rough heath land and tundra in the south with vast a vast mountain range to the north. 

Jakara's time in the plane was not wholly alone. Fetchlings would often stalk her, and she learnt early to move between camps in order to keep them at bay or fend them off with the rudimentary magic she was only just beginning to learn.

She made occasional efforts to climb the northern mountains and made decent progress, once discovering a cave containing a long deceased spell caster and their book of spells. However, eventually travel would be made impossible by the dark and cold and treacherous terrain, so she always turned back.

She survived mostly by foraging for wild berries, and catching "Godji" (a small fish-like creature that look similar to crawfish but taste vaguely like tomatoes). To pass the time she would also read the spell book, as far as she could tell it contained instructions on various occult spells can cantrips which she practiced routinely, only occasionally doing damage to herself.

## The following years
5 years ago a group of wayfarer adventures found their way into the plane and were able to rescue her and returned her to real world. Given that she had no desire to seek out her mother they allowed her entry into the guild.

Despite the horrors and struggles that come with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament, a wide eyed positive attitude and is almost incapable of deception.

## Life goals
1. See the world and meet new people
2. Help others who need it
3. Become a better spell caster
4. Avoid going into any demiplanes

## Additional points:

- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long) dislikes alcohol for what it did to her mother
- Occasionally prone to temper tantrums 
- Uneasy when left alone, dislikes the dark, liable for a panic attack when alone in the dark. Has to sleep in the same room as others
- She has a serious distrust of the clergy and related religious institutions, cannot differentiate between cultists and regular priests
- None materialistic, only owns things that the Wayfarers have given her, has no desire for riches and social status.
- Randomly believes that all innkeepers know each other and will constantly ask for "the usual" no matter where she is
