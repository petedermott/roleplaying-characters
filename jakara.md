# Jakara
## Early life

Jakara was born into a painful life. Her alcohlic "middle class" mother despised her for ruining her previously exuberant and decadent social life. 

Given that she was the result of one of her mothers numerous short term realationships she does not know who her Father is, nor does she care to having only been told how he "dropped us like a sack of shit" when her mother was pegnant (if this is true or  just manipulation by her mother is unknown)

At the age of 10 her mother gave her up to a cultist faction in exchange for every lasting youth. A novice acolyte tried to create a devil binder from her but underestimated her will and she managed to disrupt the process. This mistake cast her into a demi plane where she survived and subsisted for 30 years, life in the plane did caused her to not age physically but she continued to grow mentally and intellectually.

## Life in the demiplane
The plane she found herself in was dark and unforgiving. Days lasted 30 hours but only gave 10 of usable daylight, temperatures were a consistent 5 to 7 degrees and the ground was mostly rough heath land and tundra. She survived mostly by foradging for wild berries, and catching "godj", small fish-like creatures that look similar to crawfish but taste vaguely like tomatoes.

Jakara's time in the plane was not wholely alone, Fetchlings would often stalk her and she learnt early to move between camps in order to keep them at bay or fend them off with the rudiemntary magic she was only just beginning to learn.

## The following years
5 years ago a group of wayfarer adventures found their way into the plane and were able to rescue her, returning her to real world and bringer her into the guild.

Despite the horrors and struggles that come with surviving in the plane she has come to terms with this and a vouched to live every day as if itâ€™s her last. She has an excitable temperament, a wide eyed positive attitude and is almost incapable of deception.

## Life goals
- See the world and meet new people
- Help others who need it
- Avoid going into any more demiplanes

## Additional points:

- Cannot drink regular water, only salt water (a weird quirk of staying in the plane for so long) dislikes alcohol for what it did to her mother
- Occasionally prone to temper tantrums 
- Uneasy when left alone, dislikes the dark, liable for a panic attack when alone in the dark. Has to sleep in the same room as others
- Serious distrust of the clergy and related religious instituions, cannot differentiate between cultists and regular priests
- None materialistic, only owns things that the Wayfarers have given her
- Randomly thinks that all inn keepers  know each other, will constantly ask for "the usual" no matter where she is
