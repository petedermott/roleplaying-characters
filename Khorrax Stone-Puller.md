## Early Life
Khorrax Stone-Puller, is a half-gnoll barbarian who desperately wished to be a paladin. Born of a forbidden union between a human mother and a gnoll chieftain, Khorrax's very existence sparked a tragedy. His father, overwhelmed by shame at producing what he saw as a "weak" heir, flew into a murderous rage that claimed the lives of Khorrax's mother and their entire clan. Only baby Khorrax survived, protected by his mother's final embrace.

## Life in the church - the formative years
Fate, however, had different plans for the young half-gnoll. Father Aldwin, a traveling priest of Atea, discovered the infant among the aftermath and took him to his modest church in Millbrook. Under the priest's guidance, Khorrax grew into a peculiar sight: a hulking figure with the distinctive features of a gnoll, yet blessed with an unusual comeliness that turned heads wherever he went. His unique heritage had produced striking results - powerful muscles coupled with almost elegant features, fierce eyes that somehow managed to look soulful, and a smile that, despite his fangs, radiated warmth.

Not that Khorrax noticed the appreciative glances and whispered admirations. He remained gloriously oblivious to his admirers, too focused on his eternal struggle to become what he called a "proper holy warrior." This mission proved challenging, as Khorrax possessed both the fury of his gnoll heritage and the raw power of a true barbarian. His attempts at peaceful meditation often ended with him in the church yard, smashing stumps with his fists while shouting "BE CALM!" at the top of his lungs.

Father Aldwin, ever patient, helped Khorrax channel his natural talents into service of the community. The half-gnoll became known for his feats of strength - lifting fallen trees, carrying children on his shoulders during festivals, and fixing stubborn machinery through sheer force. These displays caught the attention of Lord Galdric who found Khorrax's ability to break "unbreakable" inventions both infuriating and fascinating.

## The lie
Then came the day of the sword trial, a clever ruse devised by the church to help a local noble family send their troublesome son to rehabilitation. Khorrax was supposed to demonstrate the impossibility of pulling the sword from the stone. Instead, his enthusiastic attempt resulted in him yanking free not just the sword, but the entire stone and the earthen foundation beneath it. Rather than seeing this as a disaster, Father Aldwin swiftly declared it a miracle, and Khorrax gained both a divine mission and his signature weapon - the "The Righteous Rock" (or "Right Rock" as he calls it).

## The current situation
Now Khorrax wanders the land, a strange sight indeed: a musclebound warrior carrying a sword still embedded in its stone, trying his best to follow the paladin's code while periodically succumbing to barbarian rage. He carefully rubs his "calm rock" when his temper flares, counts to ten (usually skipping a few numbers in his excitement), and earnestly inspects every bowl of porridge he encounters for any clues to begin his quest.

When the summons arrived for the reading of Lord Galdric's will, Khorrax saw it as another sign from the gods. After all, as he reasoned with perfect Khorrax-logic, any proper quest needed complicated clues, and who better to leave complicated clues than a complicated inventor? Whether he'll achieve the serenity of a champion, or simply continue breaking things while trying to fix them remains to be seen. 

## Life goals
1. To discover his quest
2. To become a recognised holy warrior
3. To not kill _too many_ people in the process of 1 and 2
